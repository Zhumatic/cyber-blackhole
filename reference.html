          <p>
            Establish a system that is capable of effectively mornitoring the web accessibilty of
            users inside mainland China, collect, analyze and present the data in a way that 
            could assist investors and other stakeholders in decision making.

          <H5>Background</H5>
          <p>
            With China's growing economic power, its policy making/adjustment brings enormous impact
            on global market. At the same sime, growing commercial entities are becoming dependent on China's 
            domestic market. 
            <br/><br/>
            However, China's policy making process remains opaque compring with western counterparts,
            and the enforcement of policy often detached from official legal/policy documents discloased, and
            also subject to sudden change.
            <br/><br/>
            The control of information flow is often employed by Chinese adminstration for execution of policy. 
            For example, when crypoto currency was declared illegal, platfroms for crypto trading and data were also being
            blocked inside China. Following the logic, by analyzing the data of web accessibility, the sysem able to sensor possible
            policy change in various sectors, acting as a complement for traditional market indicators.
